# Project Milestones: FSB (Full Self-Browsing)

## v9.0.2 AI Situational Awareness (Shipped: 2026-02-18)

**Delivered:** Complete AI situational awareness -- the AI sees full page context, remembers what it did, detects changes accurately, and knows when the task is done. Plus session continuity, history, replay, career workflows, memory tab, and Google Docs formatted paste.

**Phases completed:** 1-10 (21 plans total)

**Key accomplishments:**

- 3x DOM context delivery (5K -> 15K prompt budget) with priority-aware truncation and task-adaptive content modes
- Multi-signal completion verification replacing unreliable AI self-report (task-type validators, weighted scoring, critical action registry)
- Structured change detection replacing coarse hash comparison (4-channel DOM signals, structural fingerprints, false stuck elimination)
- Resilient conversation memory with hard facts, compaction fallback, and long-term memory retrieval
- Session continuity, history UI, and action replay across conversations
- Career page search with Google Sheets data entry workflows
- Memory tab population with episodic/semantic/procedural memories

**Stats:**

- 194 files created/modified
- 28,148 lines added, 1,366 lines removed
- 32,578 LOC across core JavaScript files
- 10 phases, 21 plans, 22 requirements (100% satisfied)
- 4 days from start to ship (2026-02-14 to 2026-02-18)
- 10/10 systemic issues resolved

**Git range:** `fab9fe0` -> `e0ed6d5`

## v0.9 Reliability Improvements (Shipped: 2026-02-14)

**Delivered:** Transformed FSB from unreliable "hit or miss" automation into a precise single-attempt execution engine with visual feedback, smart debugging, and fast execution.

**Phases completed:** 1-11 (24 plans total, Phase 10 deferred)

**Key accomplishments:**
- Selector generation with uniqueness scoring and coordinate fallback when all selectors fail
- Element readiness checks (visibility, interactability, obscuration) before every action
- Orange glow visual highlighting and progress overlay using Shadow DOM isolation
- 3-stage element filtering pipeline reducing DOM from 300+ to ~50 relevant elements
- Action verification with state capture, expected-effects validation, and alternative selector retry
- Debugging infrastructure: action recording, element inspector, session replay, log export
- Execution speed optimization: element caching, outcome-based delays, parallel prefetch, batch execution
- Control panel cleanup: removed dead UI code, wired Debug Mode and Test API settings

**Stats:**
- 18 files created/modified
- 43,283 lines of JavaScript
- 11 phases, 24 plans
- 2 days from start to ship (2026-02-03 to 2026-02-04)

**Git range:** `feat(01-01)` to `fix(debug)`

**What's next:** Smart multi-tab management, advanced CAPTCHA integration, workflow templates
