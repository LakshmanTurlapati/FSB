# Project Milestones: FSB (Full Self-Browsing)

## v0.9 Reliability Improvements (Shipped: 2026-02-14)

**Delivered:** Transformed FSB from unreliable "hit or miss" automation into a precise single-attempt execution engine with visual feedback, smart debugging, and fast execution.

**Phases completed:** 1-11 (24 plans total, Phase 10 deferred)

**Key accomplishments:**
- Selector generation with uniqueness scoring and coordinate fallback when all selectors fail
- Element readiness checks (visibility, interactability, obscuration) before every action
- Orange glow visual highlighting and progress overlay using Shadow DOM isolation
- 3-stage element filtering pipeline reducing DOM from 300+ to ~50 relevant elements
- Action verification with state capture, expected-effects validation, and alternative selector retry
- Debugging infrastructure: action recording, element inspector, session replay, log export
- Execution speed optimization: element caching, outcome-based delays, parallel prefetch, batch execution
- Control panel cleanup: removed dead UI code, wired Debug Mode and Test API settings

**Stats:**
- 18 files created/modified
- 43,283 lines of JavaScript
- 11 phases, 24 plans
- 2 days from start to ship (2026-02-03 to 2026-02-04)

**Git range:** `feat(01-01)` to `fix(debug)`

**What's next:** Smart multi-tab management, advanced CAPTCHA integration, workflow templates
