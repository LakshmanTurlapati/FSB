# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-04-23)

**Core value:** Reliable single-attempt execution -- the AI decides correctly, the mechanics execute precisely
**Current focus:** Validation and documentation coverage for the MCP visual-session lifecycle

## Current Position

Milestone: v0.9.36 (MCP Visual Lifecycle & Client Identity)
Phase: 205
Plan: Not started
Status: Phase 204 complete; ready to plan validation and documentation coverage
Last activity: 2026-04-24 -- Persisted client-owned visual sessions across reinjection/navigation with replay-aware stale cleanup

Progress: [██████░░░░] 67%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**

- Total plans completed this milestone: 4
- Average duration: 23 min
- Total execution time: 1.5 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 203 | 2 | 67 min | 34 min |
| 204 | 2 | 23 min | 12 min |
| 205 | 0 | - | - |

**Recent Trend:**

- Last 5 plans: 31 min, 36 min, 13 min, 10 min
- Trend: Phase 204 landed cleanly; next focus is validation and docs coverage

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Full decision log in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [v0.9.33]: Angular dashboard is the production surface (served via Docker, deployed to full-selfbrowsing.com)
- [v0.9.33]: agent-loop.js must bridge to BackgroundAnalytics -- CostTracker is session-only, not persistent
- [v0.9.34]: Vault unlock is root blocker -- everything depends on vault being unlockable first
- [v0.9.34]: Proxy command pattern -- passwords/card data never traverse WebSocket, only opaque IDs
- [v0.9.34]: MCP vault tools isolated in vault.ts, not auto-registered through TOOL_REGISTRY
- [Phase 197]: Content executeAction logging redacts credential and payment fill params — Prevents raw passwords, card numbers, and CVVs from crossing into content-script action logs.
- [v0.9.35]: MCP reliability first -- bridge lifecycle, direct tool routing, diagnostics, installer parity, and cross-host smoke validation come before new MCP feature expansion.
- [Phase 198-mcp-bridge-lifecycle-reconnect-state]: Plan 198-01 remains RED-only; production behavior is intentionally left for Plans 198-02 and 198-03.
- [Phase 198-mcp-bridge-lifecycle-reconnect-state]: Topology coverage imports mcp-server/build/bridge.js after build so later fixes are verified against package output.
- [Phase 198-mcp-bridge-lifecycle-reconnect-state]: Bridge lifecycle diagnostics remain session-scoped in chrome.storage.session; no long-lived chrome.storage.local bridge history was added.
- [Phase 198-mcp-bridge-lifecycle-reconnect-state]: Wake handling is centralized through armMcpBridge(reason), with runtime.onMessage arming only after same-extension sender validation.
- [Phase 198-mcp-bridge-lifecycle-reconnect-state]: Lifecycle timestamps are stored as ISO strings to match the Wave 0 contract and keep live state readable.
- [Phase 198-mcp-bridge-lifecycle-reconnect-state]: Relay MCP hosts now treat relay handshake as hub reachability only; extension readiness comes from hub-authored topology state.
- [Phase 198-mcp-bridge-lifecycle-reconnect-state]: Tracked mcp-server/build/index.js was updated with CLI status text because it is an existing package entry artifact; unrelated generated build drift was restored.
- [Phase 198-mcp-bridge-lifecycle-reconnect-state]: Topology diagnostics expose only metadata: mode, booleans, counts, instance IDs, heartbeat timestamp, and disconnect reason.
- [Phase 199-mcp-tool-routing-contract]: Plan 199-01 is RED-only by design; dispatcher implementation is deferred to Plans 199-02 and 199-03.
- [Phase 199-mcp-tool-routing-contract]: Restricted recovery advertises only navigate, open_tab, switch_tab, and list_tabs; run_task is not an accepted restricted recovery tool.
- [Phase 199-mcp-tool-routing-contract]: Root npm test runs Phase 198 bridge lifecycle/topology tests before the new Phase 199 route-contract tests.
- [Phase 199-mcp-tool-routing-contract]: Browser/tab MCP routes now execute through a shared dispatcher loaded before the bridge client.
- [Phase 199-mcp-tool-routing-contract]: Restricted read helper gaps return navigation-only restricted recovery responses before generic route errors.
- [Phase 199-mcp-tool-routing-contract]: The browser contract includes get_site_guide/mcp:get-site-guides, so those read-only routes are declared without changing the underlying helper behavior.
- [Phase 199-mcp-tool-routing-contract]: Autopilot and observability MCP routes now execute through the shared dispatcher instead of bridge-client background self-dispatch.
- [Phase 199-mcp-tool-routing-contract]: Public MCP tool names are preserved through explicit alias entries that point to message routes.
- [Phase 199-mcp-tool-routing-contract]: Restricted read recovery is navigation/tab-only and returned before read_page/get_dom_snapshot content-script dispatch.
- [Phase 199-mcp-tool-routing-contract]: Root npm test has unrelated runtime-contract failures deferred outside Phase 199 route work.
- [Phase 203-mcp-visual-session-contract]: Client-owned MCP visual sessions use explicit `start_visual_session` / `end_visual_session` bridge routes and stay separate from autopilot `activeSessions`.
- [Phase 203-mcp-visual-session-contract]: Trusted client identity comes from the shared allowlist in `utils/mcp-visual-session.js`; arbitrary caller branding is rejected on both server and extension sides.
- [Phase 203-mcp-visual-session-contract]: Overlay state now preserves `sessionToken`, `version`, and `clientLabel` for client-owned visual sessions so stale clear messages can be ignored immediately.
- [Phase 203-mcp-visual-session-contract]: `report_progress`, `complete_task`, `partial_task`, and `fail_task` now branch on optional `session_token`; omitted tokens preserve narration-only/task-lifecycle semantics, while matching tokens update or finalize the same client-owned visual session.
- [Phase 203-mcp-visual-session-contract]: Client-owned success, partial, and failure outcomes emit a `lifecycle: 'final'` state first and then clear the same token deterministically after the 3200ms final overlay freeze.
- [Phase 203-mcp-visual-session-contract]: Background data-tool execution now honors explicit `hadEffect: false`, which keeps narration-only `report_progress` from resetting stuck detection when executed through the shared tool executor.
- [Phase 204-overlay-badge-session-persistence]: Live overlay badge rendering stays text-only and canonical, sourced directly from the trusted `clientLabel` metadata established in Phase 203.
- [Phase 204-overlay-badge-session-persistence]: DOM-stream preview payloads now carry `clientLabel`, `sessionToken`, `version`, `lifecycle`, and `result` so mirrored surfaces do not infer identity from plain text.
- [Phase 204-overlay-badge-session-persistence]: Frozen Angular preview overlays preserve the last trusted client badge until the visual session is actually cleared.
- [Phase 204-overlay-badge-session-persistence]: Client-owned visual sessions persist in `chrome.storage.session` as explicit records with `lastUpdateAt`, optional `finalClearAt`, and canonical overlay metadata.
- [Phase 204-overlay-badge-session-persistence]: Background replays persisted visual-session state when the main-frame content surface becomes ready again through either `contentScriptReady` or port readiness.
- [Phase 204-overlay-badge-session-persistence]: The existing 60s degrade and 120s orphan posture remains authoritative, and final overlay replay resumes from stored remaining freeze time instead of resetting it.

### Pending Todos

- Deferred Angular migration requirements (DASH-08 through MIGR-03) remain parked from v0.9.29.
- Plan Phase 205: validate and document the visual-session start/progress/end contract, badge surfaces, and persistence/cleanup behavior.
- Root `npm test` still has unrelated `tests/runtime-contracts.test.js` assertions deferred outside Phase 200.

### Blockers/Concerns

- v0.9.34 archived with accepted validation debt: stale `gaps_found` milestone audit, 19 unchecked requirements preserved in the archive, and pending live UAT for Phase 191 and Phase 197.
- v0.9.35 was archived without a standalone milestone-audit file, and Phase 202 preserves explicit residual risk around paid-model live host prompt sessions.
